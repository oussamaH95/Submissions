            Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years,
            mostly using one-to-one correspondence with fingers. The earliest
            counting device was probably a form of tally stick. Later record
            keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay
            spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably
            livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.[4][5]
            The use of counting rods is one example.

          <p>
            The first mobile computers were heavy and ran from mains power. The
            50lb IBM 5100 was an early example.

          <h4>First computing device</h4>
          <p>
            During the first half of the 20th century, many scientific computing
            needs were met by increasingly sophisticated analog computers, which
            used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a
            basis for computation. However, these were not programmable and
            generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital
            computers.[19] The first modern analog computer was a
            tide-predicting machine, invented by Sir William Thomson in 1872.
            The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to
            solve differential equations by integration using wheel-and-disc
            mechanisms, was conceptualized in 1876 by James Thomson, the brother
            of the more famous Lord Kelvin.

          <h4>Digital computers</h4>
          <p>
            Early digital computers were electromechanical; electric switches
            drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation. These devices
            had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much
            faster all-electric computers, originally using vacuum tubes. The
            Z2, created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939, was one of the
            earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer.[20]
