      The U.N. estimates that up to 8 million children around the world are
      living in orphanages. It is likely to rise due to the increasing impact of
      conflict, climate change, and the HIV and AIDS pandemic, especially those
      living in Africa.

          Children at an early age often demonstrate a delay in emotional,
          social, physical development, and also are at greater risk of
          contracting diseases.

          Not all children are treated equally in orphanages. Some children are
          exposed to risk factors, lack of nutrition, stress, and exposure to
          toxic substances. Children who are sickly are more challenging to care
          for thatâ€™s why they are usually ignored by staff. If a child responds
          easily when spoken to or touched, the caregiver gets some satisfaction
          from that response.

          A quality of life is not usually experienced by children in
          orphanages. Children need to be healthy and happy to be fully
          functioning adults. The relationships between adults and children are
          usually superficial and brief, with little warmth and affection. Staff
          in orphanages do not connect emotionally or physically with children
          in the same way that families connect with children.
